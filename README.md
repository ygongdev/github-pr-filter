# github-pr-filter

A google chrome extension that given a glob pattern string, filters your github pull request's changed files by collapsing them.

## Prerequisite
1. [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch)
2. [browserify](https://github.com/browserify/browserify)

## Usage
1. Run `browserify assets/filterGlob.js --s filterGlob > filterGlob-bundle.js`.
2. [Load the unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#manifest)
3. Go to any pull request's changed files page and you should see the widget

## Implementation

### Glob Filter Widget
We search for the github toolbar with all the widgets and append our widget in there. From there, you can enter a glob pattern string and when you press `Run filter`, we'll collapse any opened files that matches the glob pattern.

### Glob pattern matching
This extension uses [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) to perform the glob matching. Because `minimatch` is a node package and uses `cjs`. We need to use a bundler to generate an `esm`, since browsers can only use `esm`.
So I chose [browserify](https://github.com/browserify/browserify).
